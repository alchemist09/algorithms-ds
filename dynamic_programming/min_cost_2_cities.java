/* There are N stations in a route, starting from 0 to N-1. A train moves from 
* station (0) to the last station (N-1) in only forward direction. The cost of
* ticket between any two station is given. Find the minimum cost of travel between
* station (0) to station (N-1)
* 
* ***********************************************************************
* ****************************** SOLUTION *******************************
* ***********************************************************************
* 
* First you define data structure in which cost of ticket between stations is 
* stored. If we have four stations (0 to 3), and the cost of ticket is stored
* in a 4 * 4 matrix as below
* 
*    cost[][] = {
*      {0, 10, 75, 94},
*      {-1, 0, 35, 50},
*      {-1, -1, 0, 80},
*      {-1, -1, -1, 0}
*    } 
* 
* cost[i][j] is cost of station from station i to station j. Since we are not
* moving backwards, cost[i][j] does not make sense when i > j, and hence they 
* are all -1. If i==j, then we are at the same station where we want to go,
* therefore all the diagonal elements are zeros.
* 
* If we want to move from station-0 to station-2, the cheapest way is to take 
* the ticket of station-1 from station-0, then the ticket of station-2 from 
* station-1. This way the total cost of travel is USD45(10+35). If we take the
* direct ticket of station-2 from station-0, then the cost of travel is USD75.
* 
* If minCost(s, d) is the minimum cost of travelling from station-s to station-d,
* the minimum cost to reach N-1 from 0 can be recursively defined as 
* 
*         minCost(0, N-1) {
*            MIN {
*              cost[0][N-1],
*              minCost(0, 2) + minCost(2, N-1),
*              ... ... ... ...,
*              minCost(0, N-2) + cost[N-2][N-1]
*            } 
*         }
* 
* First option is to go directly to station N-1 from station-0 without any break.
* Second option is to break at station-i and so on. When we break at station-i, 
* we calculate the minimum cost of moving from 0-i, and then the minimum cost of
* moving from i to N-1.
